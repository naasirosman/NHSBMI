# NHSBMI

How the BMI calculator works (JavaScript):

- once the "calculate" is clicked, it fetches what is in the feet, inches, weight fields and applies the BMI equation to it
- there are if statements to ensure that the user inputs a valid height, weight, and age (as well as ensuring adult tab is not used for u18s and child tab not used for under 2s and over 18s)

Improvements to be made:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- regardless if there is a problem of user input, it will go to the result page
- all fields are not madatory
- doesn't show ".riskRace" when Bangladeshi, Indian, Black African or Black Caribbean is selected
